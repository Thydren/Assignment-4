            <h2>War and Death</h2>
            <p>Alan studied at King's College from 1931-1934 and earned first class honors in math. By 22, he published a dissertation proving the central limit theorem. He also published a paper called "On Computable Numbers" which was the first documentation about his hypothetical "Turing Machine". He theorized that his "universal computing machine" could solve any math problem if it is formulated into an algorithm. This idea is the basic foundation for what will eventually lead to modern computers. From 1936-1938, Turing was studying in Princeton. It was here that he became well versed in cryptology, something that would aid in the war effort later. A few years later in 1938, Turing began working part time with the Government Code and Cypher School. It was here his work began for the war. He discovered the first move the German Navy was going to make and statistically developed better word strategies. He was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire by King Geroge VI. About 6 years after the war, Alan met Arnold Murray. The two dated for 2 months before he was forced to admit to police that he was gay. Due to homosexuality being illegal in England at the time, he was given the option to go to prison or be chemically castrated. Two years after his sentenced he would be found dead in his home from an apparent suicide by cyanide poisoning.</p>
